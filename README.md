## About Automatic Sidebar

### Usage

Enhanced on the basis of the default theme, now you only need to define an object, with the key as the path and the value as a fixed value: `auto`, to enable the automatic sidebar.

```js
export default {
  themeConfig: {
    sidebar: {
      // When the user is located in the `guide` directory, this sidebar will be displayed, and the sidebar data will be automatically scanned from the <root>/guide/ directory
      '/guide/': 'auto',
      // When the user is located in the `config` directory, this sidebar will be displayed, and the sidebar data will be automatically scanned from the <root>/config/ directory
      '/config/': 'auto'
    }
  }
};

```

The default theme's sidebar is already sufficient to cover various application scenarios, but it does not support automatic generation of sidebar structure based on directory structure. Although it can be assisted by [community plugins](https://github.com/hacxy/awesome-vitepress?tab=readme-ov-file#community-plugins), the plugins also have shortcomings and cannot meet all my needs:

- Firstly, the data structure, the file directory structure itself is a tree structure, so when scanning the entire directory, it should cover all subdirectories and retain these structures to output the final `sidebar` structure.

- Support for single sidebar, as well as multiple sidebars

- Can control sidebar content and behavior through frontmatter

- Flexible sorting, can sort groups, as well as individual files under each group

- Simple configuration, compatible with the original sidebar configuration rules

- Hot update, when adding or removing `md` files, it can generate the latest sidebar structure and render it to the page, which will greatly improve the document development experience.

- Performance, try not to sacrifice too many resource usage, the hot update process during document writing is smooth and fast.

To meet the above needs, I spent a lot of time rewriting some components and combined them with build-time data loading, and the final effect has reached my expectations. Now the sidebar configuration is more flexible and intelligent, and it is one of my favorite features at present.
